# a summary about you
summary: |
  I'm a Vancouver based Full Stack Software Developer with over 10 years of professional experience using a large variety of programming languages, frameworks, technologies, and deployment environments. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Concordia University and a professional D.E.C. in Computer Science from Vanier College.

  I enjoy web development, database design, and learning new technologies. Iâ€™m strong at both backend and frontend coding, although weaker at UI design (which I'm happy to use themes/Bootstrap to circumvent). I've worked with so many different languages and technologies throughout my career that I've learned how to pickup new ones very quickly.
